The bft consensus algorithm has been used instead of the raft algorithm. 
This is a more Byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithm, which is more resistant to malicious nodes.
The chacha20-poly1305 encryption algorithm has been used instead of the aes-256 algorithm.
This is a newer and more efficient encryption algorithm that provides a similar level of security.
The mirrored replication strategy has been used instead of the 3x strategy. 
This means that each data piece will be replicated to all nodes in the network, which provides the highest level of reliability.
