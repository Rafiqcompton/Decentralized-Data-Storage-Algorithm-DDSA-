# Decentralized-Data-Storage-Algorithm-DDSA-
DDSA is an algorithm for implementing a decentralized data storage system using blockchain technology. It works by dividing data into small pieces, encrypting each piece, and storing the encrypted pieces on a distributed network of nodes. This makes it more secure, reliable, and scalable than traditional data storage systems.
